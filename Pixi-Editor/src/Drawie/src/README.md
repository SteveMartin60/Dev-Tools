# What is this project?

DRAWIE (Drawing Engine) is a engine that bundles a set of APIs used to create 2D apps.
The goal of the project is to provide configurable modules that can be used in different scenarios. It doesn't assume
platforms, operating systems, UI frameworks or even drawing apis. 

Built-in set of modules makes DRAWIE a complete GPU accelerated drawing engine with windowing, graphics api and compute shaders.

# Core TODO list

- [x] Platform-agnostic windowing API
- [x] Drawing Backend API
- [x] Render API
- [x] Vulkan Renderer
- [ ] Compute Shaders API
- [ ] Web support
- [x] Avalonia plug-in graphics
